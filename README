# Synthetic Dataset for Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

This dataset is generated synthetically for demonstrating simple linear regression. It contains 100 samples with a single feature `X` and a continuous target variable `y`.

## Data Generation Process

The dataset was generated using the following process:
1. `X` values are randomly generated between 0 and 2.
2. `y` values are calculated using the equation: `y = 4 + 3 * X + noise`, where noise is randomly added to introduce variability.

## File Description

- `synthetic_dataset.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset with the following columns:
  - `X`: Feature
  - `y`: Target variable

## Usage

The dataset can be used for practicing linear regression techniques, including:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a linear regression model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²)
- Visualizing the regression line and actual vs. predicted values

## Example

Here's an example of how to load and use the dataset in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
